### ❓ Problem Statement

Leadership lacked a visual way to track whether locations were meeting their ticket processing targets. The need was for a clean, high-level visual that instantly flags over- and under-performers.

---

### 💼 Key Business Questions

- Which branches are exceeding or falling behind on targets?
- What percentage of tickets is processed by each location?
- Are there trends or patterns that require leadership follow-up?

---

### 🛠 Tools & Techniques

- **Tool:** Tableau Public
- **Techniques:**
    - Bar chart with dynamic color logic
    - Reference line at 60% target
    - Conditional formatting for under/over performance
    - Ranked horizontal bar chart

---

### ✨ Features

- Red = Over Target, Grey = Below Target
- % Tickets Processed for 10+ locations

---

### 💡 Insights & Recommendations

- Two locations consistently outperformed (85–90% ticket resolution)
